## Project setup

```bash
$ yarn install
```

## Compile and run the project

```bash
# development
$ yarn run start

# watch mode
$ yarn run start:dev

# production mode
$ yarn run start:prod
```
## Key Assumption
- Backend is always aware of new currencies to be added
- Frontend requires an endpoint to get rate to display to user
-

## Summary Of Implementation
The key point of this test is to ensure users can hold multiple currencies. Hence, easy of adding new currencies, and updating balances atomically is very important.

So, I designed the API to have a table for balances, hence either automatically or manually, new currencies can easily be added per user.

If needed, a particular currency can also be disabled for specific user in case of security or fraud activity.

Balances can also be updated without worry of overwriting or failed atomicity.

One thing that's missing during conversion in the current implementation is db (row) locking which is very important to ensure only a single transaction per currency can be performed at a time.

## Run tests

```bash
# unit tests
$ yarn run test

# e2e tests
$ yarn run test:e2e

# test coverage
$ yarn run test:cov
```
